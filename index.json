We argue that in communities with high levels of reported violence, individuals lose political and social trust, develop exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups, and find appeal in nonconventional, black‐or‐white religious teachings, all of which can promote support for extremist violence. Using survey data from over 17,000 respondents in 84 communes surveyed between 2013 and 2017 in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad, we find strong support for these predictions. More violent communities express substantially greater support for violent extremism, with an increase in exclusionary outgroup biases and a turn to fundamentalist religious views being the primary mechanisms explaining—and amplifying—the effect. The findings run counter to arguments suggesting that exposure to violence leads to “war weariness” or generates community resilience to extremism via prosocial behaviors.","tags":null,"title":"Community Violence and Support for Violent Extremism: Evidence From the Sahel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kim Mannemar Sønderskov","Peter Thisted Dinesen","Steven E.

Previous studies report mixed results with respect to voter turnout, in contrast to the positive effects found for other indicators of political engagement. However, previous turnout studies have failed to differentiate between violent and non-violent crime, and have relied on cross-sectional survey data that is prone to measurement biases and selection effects. This article addresses these shortcomings via a panel analysis of official registry data from Denmark recording individual-level turnout in two municipal elections (in 2009 and 2013) and victimization from violent and non-violent crime. It identifies the effect of victimization by comparing changes in turnout between the two elections for victims and two different counterfactual groups: non-victims in the general population, and individuals who were victimized after the 2013 election. The results show that victimization from violent crime increases turnout by 2 to 3 percentage points. The study further demonstrates a large negative between-individual effect of victimization, suggesting that previous studies have been marred by severe selection bias.","tags":null,"title":"Crime Victimization Increases Turnout: Evidence from Individual-Level Administrative Panel Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John McCauley","Steven Finkel","Michael Neureiter","Christopher Belasco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0092b7e5d136589ed043d9805be3ff46","permalink":"/publication/finkel-grapevine-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T17:42:12.887427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/finkel-grapevine-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This study presents a pattern overlooked in previous research on measuring sensitive political outcomes: over the course of data collection, responses tend to shift in the direction of support for the local incumbent power. We suggest that, whereas earlier responses are largely devoid of this social desirability bias, word of the research spreads across enumeration areas, and individuals interviewed later in the process alter their responses out of fear of retribution for inappropriate answers. We document the pattern using original data from two surveys on support for violent extremism conducted in three different countries in the Sahel region of Africa. We rule out a host of alternative explanations and further confirm that the pattern can arise not just with overt survey measures but even with covert, experimental ones. We then demonstrate the same pattern using out-of-sample data from a separate well-known study. The findings offer a cautionary note to both conventional and experimental approaches to measuring sensitive attitudes.","tags":null,"title":"The grapevine effect in sensitive data collection: examining response patterns in support for violent extremism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.E.Finkel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"892a3032fc8c4387a6419dda961373d6","permalink":"/publication/finkel-sage-2020/","publishdate":"2019-06-17T17:42:12.887427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/finkel-sage-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Causal Analysis With Panel Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fredrik Falkenström","Steven Finkel","Rolf Sandell","Julian A Rubel","Rolf Holmqvist"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1c33942b83b79d944e5b8dfa1fefd75d","permalink":"/publication/finkel-dm-2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-25T17:42:12.887427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/finkel-dm-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a need for rigorous methods to study the mechanisms that lead to individual-level change (i.e., process-outcome research). We argue that panel data (i.e., longitudinal study of a number of individuals) methods have 3 major advantages for psychotherapy researchers: (1) enabling microanalytic study of psychotherapeutic processes in a clinically intuitive way, (2) modeling lagged associations over time to ensure direction of causality, and (3) isolating within-patient changes over time from between-patient differences, thereby protecting against confounding influences because of the effects of unobserved stable attributes of individuals. However, dynamic panel data methods present a complex set of analytical challenges. We focus on 2 particular issues: (1) how long-term trajectories in the variables of interest over the study period should be handled, and (2) how the use of a lagged dependent variable as a predictor in regression-based dynamic panel models induces endogeneity (i.e., violation of independence between predictor and model error term) that must be taken into account in order to appropriately isolate within- and between-person effects.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Models of Individual Change in Psychotherapy Process Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steven E.
